# a24-site
For the FA'22 Intensive, I wanted to create a visual website showcasing some of the eclectic work of a24's productions.
Displayed some of the films/shows on visual cards that have links to the film/show's trailer/info on them for users to check out if interested.
Used javascript to filter through the items into different categories.
